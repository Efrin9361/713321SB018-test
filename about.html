    <p style="margin-top: 5%;">The County has reimagined its operational approach to planning and decision making by integrating the General Management System</b> 
     (GMS) with the strategic framework adopted by the Board of Supervisors. It takes the GMS in a direction that is reflective of</b>
     today’s communities while preserving the core management principles of strategic planning, operational accountability, enterprise-wide</b>
     collaboration, and employee connection. At the core of the reimagined GMS is Community Engagement, based on the principle that all</b>
      that we do should be for, and created in partnership with, the people we serve. The outer ring is included to reflect the core</b>
       values of everything we do: integrity, equity, access, belonging, excellence and sustainability.</p>
