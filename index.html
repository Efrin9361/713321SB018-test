        <p style="margin-top: 5%;"> Our General Management System provides the service to the customers.The County has reimagined its operational approach to
             planning and decision making by integrating the General Management System (GMS) with the strategic framework adopted by
              the Board of Supervisors. It takes the GMS in a direction that is reflective of today’s communities while preserving the
               core management principles of strategic planning, operational accountability, enterprise-wide collaboration, and 
               employee connection. At the core of the reimagined GMS is Community Engagement, based on the principle that all that we 
               do should be for, and created in partnership with, the people we serve. The outer ring is included to reflect the core
                values of everything we do: integrity, equity, access, belonging, excellence and sustainability.</p>
